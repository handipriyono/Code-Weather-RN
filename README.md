## Instructions to Run React Native Repository

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your React Native project directory using `cd`.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

3. Once you're in the project directory, run the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. After the installation is complete, start the project with the following command:

   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```

This command will start your React Native project and clear the Metro bundler cache.
